# Language change and Piotrowski’s law

This repository contains input data, the results, and the code to replicate our findings, for the study _Modeling the dynamics of language change: logistic regression, Piotrowski’s law, and a handful of examples in Polish_. The paper has been sent to the Journal of Quantitative Linguistics, but its pre-print version can be found here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06324](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06324).

**Eder, M. and Górski, R. L.** 

The repository has the following structure:

* `data`: input datasets used in our study
* `figures`: a complete set of results (plots with fitted models)
* `language_change_code.R`: code to replicate the tests

As for the original coprus used in our study, this cannot be made publicly available due to copyright reasons. We can provide the corpus on request, though. The attached datasets are sufficient to replicate our results.
